# Two observable trends based on the PyCity School data

**1.  Funding rates**  - Higher funding rates per student do not equate to better test scores.  I don't know where this data comes from, as it was not cited in our homework, so I don't know how factual it is. But this trend surprised me.  You certainly hear the opposite whenever school funding is discussed.  It would be interesting to dig deeper into this and look for other trends within this category.

**2.  School size** - Both small (< 1000 students) and medium (1000 - 2000 students) sized schools showed similar results in their test scores.  Large schools (> 2000 students) on the other hand, showed significant lower scores compared to the other two.  This trend was also surprising as you also tend to hear small schools produce better test scores.  This data would suggest that schools up to 2000 students do not have a negative impact on student's test scores.
